	<p>  <strong>Define HTML.</strong>
	HTML defined as a markup language which is a way of annotating a document in such a way to make the annotations
	distinct from the text being annotated. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Define Client-server model of communications.</strong>
	This model contains two side: clients, and servers. The server is a computer agent that is normally active 24/7,
	listening for queries from any client who make a request. A client is a computer agent that makes requests and
	receives responses from the server, in the form of response codes, images, text files, and other data. Within the
	client server model, the request response loop is the most basic mechanism on the server for receiving requests and
	transmitting data in response. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Write down the name of different types of servers.</strong>
	Email server / Web server / Media server / Data server / Application server / Authentication server </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Define a Web Server.</strong>
	A web server is, at a fundamental level, nothing more than a computer that responds to HTTP requests. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Define Data Centers.</strong>
	A single web server that is also acting as an application or database server will be hard pressed to handle
	more than a few hundred requests a second, so the usual strategy for busier sites is to use a server farm. Server
	farms are typically housed in special facilities called data centers. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Why do we need a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)?</strong>
	In order to allow clients to request particular resources from the server, a naming mechanism is required so that
	the client knows how to ask the server for the file. For the web that naming mechanism is the Uniform Resource
	Locator (URL). </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Give an example of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and specify all components of an URL.</strong> </p>
	<p> http://www.funwebdev.com/index.php?page=17#article </p>
	<p> Protocol: http </p>
	<p> Domain: www.funwebdev.com </p>
	<p> Path: index.php </p>
	<p> Query String: page=17 </p>
	<p> Fragment: article </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>What is the difference between a static and a dynamic web site?</strong> Static web sites consist only
	of HTML pages that look identical for all users at all times. On the other hand, dynamic web sites use programs
	running on web servers to generate content dynamically. These server based programs would read content from	databases,
	interface with existing enterprise computer systems, communicate with financial institutions, and then output HTML
	that would be sent back to the users’ browsers. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Why do we need Domain Name System (DNS)?</strong> We use Domain Name System (DNS) to recall web sites.
	It is an easier way instead of using IP addresses with not long strings of numbers. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Describe in detail the process of DNS address resolution?</strong>
	
	<p>  <strong>Give some examples of generic top-Level domains (gTLD).</strong>
	.com / .org / .net / .gov </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Give some examples of country code top-Level domains (ccTLD).</strong>
	.ca / .uk / .fr / .ir </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>How can you pass a user’s information from the client to the web server?</strong>
	By query strings. They are the way of passing information such as user form input from the client to the server. In
	URL's they are encoded as key value pairs delimited by “&” symbols and preceded by the “?” symbol. </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>What is the function (purpose) of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</strong>
	The HTTP protocol establishes a TCP connection on port 80 (by default). The server waits for the request, and then
	responds with a response code, headers and an optional message (which can include files). </p>
	
	<p>  <strong>Describe how a single web page is displayed on a web browser.</strong> The experience of seeing a
	single web page is facilitated by the client's browser which requests the initial HTML page, then parses the returned
	HTML to find all the resources referenced from within it. </p>
	
	
	<p>  <strong>Give some examples of HTTP request methods.</strong> GET and POST / HAED / CONNECT / TRACE </p>
